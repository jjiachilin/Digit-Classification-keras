This is a deep learning mini-project from Francis Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python" to help me 
get familiar with keras and tensorflow. This network aims to tackle the classical machine learning problem 
of handwritten digit classification. The network consists of 2 dense layers with RELU and softmax 
activation functions respectively. I used the RMSprop optimization function and categorical crossentropy 
loss function for backpropogation. The network was trained in 10 epochs with a batch size of 64 and achieved 
99.72% accuracy for the training set and 98.14% accuracy for the test set. I've learned about the math behind
neural networks and it's amazing to me how keras is able to abstract all of this for the average developer. 
I do wonder if there are any performance benefits to writing out all of the tensor operations in Tensorflow 
on its own.
